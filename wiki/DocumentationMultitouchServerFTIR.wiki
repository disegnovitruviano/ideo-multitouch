#summary Information on installation and use of the Multitouch FTIR Server.

= Introduction =

This software interprets data from a webcam used in conjunction with an ftir screen to generate multitouch events for the IDEO Flash multitouch API it also compensates for camera alignment, rotation and fisheye

= Installation =
 * download and install [http://www.processing.org processing]
 * download and unzip [http://ideo-multitouch.googlecode.com/files/MultitouchServerFTIR.zip MultitouchServerFTIR] to your processing sketches folder
 * download and install [http://webcamxtra.sourceforge.net/download.shtml JMyron]
 * if you're running on an Intel mac, download and install this [http://www.jibberia.com/projects/ libJMyron.jnilib] compiled for intel Macs   
 * download and install [http://www.v3ga.net/processing/BlobDetection/index-page-download.html blobDetection]
 * run the FTIR server in processing's "present mode"
 * perform a calibration
 * run the FTIR server (present mode not required)
 * minimize the FTIR server application and run Flash applications.

= Operation =
   * get web cam image
   * perform background subtraction
   * perform blob tracking
   * map blob positions into calibrated space
   * send touchEvents over socket

= Keyboard commands =
 * press 'c' to calibrate then touch each of the points as they pop up
 * press 'd' to cycle through levels of graphical information

= File architecture =
 * PerpsectiveCorrection handles calibration
 * [http://incubator.quasimondo.com fastblur] does a fast (approximate) blur on the image
 * all other java files are matrix libraries used for calibration calculation.
